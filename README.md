##A GUI management console for mocks of AWS's SQS and ElasticMQ

This application serves as a graphical management console for [ElasticMQ](https://github.com/softwaremill/elasticmq) to assist with configuration and verification within a testing enviornment.

_NOTE_: This project is in an extremely early state.  It currently serves two purposes: 
1) To teach myself the Vue Framework, and bush up on my NodeJS
2) To make my life easier working with ElasticMQ as a mock for AWS's Simple Queue Service during development of a work project.

### Project Status
It is currently in _VERY_ early development, but once I have the initial base of this application put together I will add a status page indiciating what actions SQS are available from the application and provide a docker container as the "full stack" ready for deployment & usage as a full mock solution.
